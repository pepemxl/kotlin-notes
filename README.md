# Kotlin Notes


**Kotlin** is a modern programming language that **is concise, safe, pragmatic, and focused on interoperability with Java code**.
It can be used almost everywhere Java is used today: for server-side development, Android apps, and much more.



```kotlin
fun main(args: Array<String>) {
    println("Hello World!")
}
```
